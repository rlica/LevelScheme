Level Scheme Generator
======================
This is a code that one can use to generate publication quality level schemes
fairly easily. There is a little bit of manual setup that needs to be done, but
I am going to work under the assumption that people can follow/read direction.

The code is heavily commented to help with the use. If you have questions or
comments please feel free to send them my way
